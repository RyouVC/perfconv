# 🎼 perfconv

> **Note:**
> perfconv is pretty much incomplete, it may not actually work as intended, or just outright make garbage charts.

**perfconv** is a tool for converting song charts for the **Performai** rhythm game family:

- **CHUNITHM**
- **maimai DX**
- **O.N.G.E.K.I**

This tool is for converting proprietary arcade charts into a format compatible with other simulators.

This project is for **interoperability and educational use** only.

It is **not** a replacement for the official games, nor does it include any copyrighted music or assets.

## 🔒 Disclaimer: These Games Are Still Active

The **Performai** series — _CHUNITHM_, _maimai DX_, and _O.N.G.E.K.I_ — are still **actively developed and supported by SEGA**, primarily in Japanese arcades and a few licensed international locations.

This project is **not** a replacement for the official games.
It does **not** intend to compete with or undermine SEGA's work.

> Instead, this tool exists to support:
>
> - Content preservation
> - Community-driven simulation
> - Cross-compatibility tooling
> - Access for regions with no arcade availability

We encourage players to support the official releases where available.
This is about keeping the games alive _when they’re otherwise out of reach_ — not replacing them.

## ❓ FAQ

### "Why are you doing this?"

Science. Why not? I can go on for hours about how I just see these things as puzzles to solve, but the short answer is:

**Because I can. Fuck you.**

...Also they're just plaintext data, no binary shenanigans so eh, no use gatekeeping plaintext either.

### “Isn’t this dangerous for the scene?”

No.

The real danger is relying on fragile simulators, closed-source tools, and scene politics to preserve games.

**Porting charts keeps content alive when the corporations won’t.**

---

### “You’re disrespecting \[sim developer\] by doing this! Now they’re gonna crash out and quit!”

Then so be it.

I’m not here to cater to a single paranoid Japanese indie dev who treats community content like personal property and melts down over people doing things “the wrong way.”

If a sim can’t handle real-world content, it’s not a viable platform — it’s a toy.

> This project is a vote of confidence in **open source simulators** and developers who actually care about openness, contribution, and sustainability — not control, fear, or fragile egos.

Hell, at that point I might as well make another [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/).
_EBA/Ouendan died and was replaced by a FOSS project that actually cares about the community — why can't we do the same here?_

See:

- [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/) and [Pump It Up](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)>)
- [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/)

### "You're gonna get C&D'd! Maybe even sued by \[company\]!"

**Good. Let them.**

Maybe then they’ll notice there’s demand and finally release a real home version — like that _other_ company that offers a subscription-based PC client (VPN-only or not).

**Until then?**
Players will play however they can. Or keep playing the blue hedgehog game instead.

---

### “Players won’t appreciate the original game anymore!”

That's not how this works.

Nobody downloads decrypted arcade dumps and builds cross-platform simulators just for novelty.
**If they’re doing this, they already love the original game.**

Arcades will always be the better experience — from cabinet feel to social atmosphere — and people _will_ still go when they can.

> This is about keeping games playable _when they can’t be played any other way_ —
> especially when puritanical soccer moms throw a fit over anime cleavage and kill off international releases.

### “You’re fragmenting the scene.”

**The scene fragmented itself** — by:

- Hiding tools
- Hoarding charts
- Gatekeeping contribution
- Letting fear dictate development

This project exists to **reunite players through openness and preservation**.
Because when the devs give up?
**We build anyway.**

---

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> If you're converting from a real disk dump, **do not share the disk image or original data files.**  
> You may use converted charts in compatible simulators, but distributing the original (or converted) files as-is is strongly discouraged.
